I was playing a game that in order to be more
	productive i had to buy the exact number of 
	products that was purchasable.
	
The cost of the product is 3000.

Since there was a time limit,best practice was to
	buy the Purchasable amount as i hear it,so did I.

Feature Improvements:
*Making the sound work faster and offline.
*Speeding up the Devider to be more efficient
*Setting up exceptions
*The text to speech system should recognise different languages.
